# Saylor Academy course backup files

## About
These are backup files for Saylor Academy's courses publicly available at https://learn.saylor.org (our Moodle LMS). The course files do not include native Moodle assessments.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate access to course files for reuse, e.g. on a university LMS.

## Format
The two file formats are **.mbz** (Moodle backup) and **.imscc** (IMS Common Cartridge), which should be compatible with major learning management systems.

## Licensing

We use the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license by default, which applies to our course frameworks/syllabi -- sequencing, arrangement, instructions, original content, etc. Our courses comprise curated third-party learning materials under a variety of licenses.

## Support
